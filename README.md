# üé® Hirst Dot Painting (Python Turtle + Colorgram)
This project recreates a Hirst-style dot painting - inspired by the artwork of Damien Hirst - using Python‚Äôs built-in Turtle Graphics module and colors extracted from real image with the Colorgram library.

# ‚ú® Features
  - Generates a 10x10 grid of colorful dots
  - Uses RGB color tuples extracted from an image via the colorgram package
  - Renders art dynamically with Python Turtle
  - Randomizes dot colors for every run
  - Produces a satisfying, abstract, pop-art pattern

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
  1. Clone or download this repository
  2. Install the required package:
    - pip install colorgram.py
  3. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed
  4. Run the script:
    python main.py

# üß† Concepts Practiced
  - Using Python‚Äôs turtle graphics module
  - Working with RGB color values
  - Basic loops and coordinate movement
  - Combining creativity with code
